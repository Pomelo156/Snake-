## Description :books:
I plan to create the game Snake and add some new features based on the original :snake: game.

## :fire: Features :fire:
- Feature 1
	- random obstacle appear :no_entry:
- Feature 2
  	- add a background music :musical_note:
- Feature 3
	- multiple food to eat :icecream:

## :scream: Challenges :scream:
- I need to do a little research on pygame about allowing the player to use their keyboard :arrow_up: :arrow_right: :arrow_down: :arrow_left:
- A little research on the font pygame has, and use it in the text(scores, and UI)  :abcd:
- ....more

## Outcomes

Ideal Outcome :star_struck:
- create a snake built with :green_square: and trying to get food as :yellow_circle: and avoid traps or obstacles as :small_red_triangle:, and keep playing until hit the wall, obstacles, or itself.
- try to create some fancy color effect in the future:interrobang:
- chilling music :musical_note:

Minimal Viable Outcome :cry:
- the very basic function of the game
- how about just make it playable QAQ
 

## Milestones :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- Week 1 :alarm_clock:
  1. write some pseudocode on what function we need
  2. do some challenging research

- Week 2 :alarm_clock:
  1. break the code apart and work on the functions
  2. I'm sure I will need to do more research while working on it.
  3. try to have the features added
  4. ask for TA's help if needed

- Week N (Final) :alarm_clock:
  1. wrap up everything and keep it organized and clean
  2. start test play
  3. make changes to the stats
